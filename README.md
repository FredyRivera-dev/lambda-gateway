# lambda-gateway

## Overview

**lambda-gateway** started as an experimental project born from curiosity and the desire to learn how serverless hosting platforms like Vercel, AWS Lambda, and others work under the hood. This project represents a hands-on approach to understanding the core concepts behind serverless architectures.

## About This Project

This is a demo implementation of a serverless hosting platform built with:
- **Docker** - For containerization and isolated execution environments
- **FastAPI** - Powering the backend API
- **Next.js** - Driving the frontend interface

The goal is to replicate, at a fundamental level, how serverless platforms handle code deployment, execution, and management.

## Prerequisites

Before running lambda-gateway, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python** (with pip)
- **Node.js** (with npm)
- **Docker**

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FredyRivera-dev/lambda-gateway.git
   cd lambda-gateway
   ```

2. **Start the Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Follow instructions in backend/README.md
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   # Follow instructions in frontend/README.md
   ```

## Project Structure

```
lambda-gateway/
├── backend/     # FastAPI backend - See README.md for detailed instructions
└── frontend/    # Next.js frontend - See README.md for detailed instructions
```

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with specific setup and configuration instructions.
